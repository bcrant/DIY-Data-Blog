# Life After Spreadsheets:  <br/> Python for Productive People

It’s not exactly the first thing I tell people at parties, but… I love spreadsheets.  

To me, there is nothing quite as satisfying as a nicely aligned, well labeled, and color coordinated spreadsheet.

And for most people, most of the time, spreadsheets are the right choice for the job. They are the most accessible, the easiest to use, and offer the best set of tools for organizing, manipulating, and presenting data.

But for some people, there may come a day when their data needs exceed that of what can be accomplished in a spreadsheet efficiently. This is exactly where I found myself a couple of years into my career: knee deep in spreadsheets, working twice as hard but only making slightly more of an impact.

If you reach this juncture, there are only a few paths forwards:
* Accept the manual overhead and repetition  
* Double down on spreadsheets, macros, and VBA
* Learn a scripting language like Python or R

I know I can relate.

Does any of this sound familiar? Is this you? How many `csv` and `xlsx` files are on your desktop?

For the Python-curious, Python-reluctant, and those beginning to learn Python, making the jump to programming can be an intimidating one. I've been there.  

In fact, I did everything in my power _to avoid_ learning Python.

I had been flirting with basic command line utilities like `cat`, `awk`, `sed`, and `mv` to handle some of the influx of text files I was working with. I ventured into Homebrew and downloaded additional packages like `csvkit` and `jq`, which I still

### Avoid Reinventing the Wheel
When solving business problems, you very rarely will need to venture into uncharted territory. This is especially true of Python, which attracts users from many different professional and academic fields, and has an immense collection of extended functionalities on [The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/).

That is not to say that your problem is not complex, or that your solution will not be unique to your specific set of circumstances. A common example may be the specific combination of third-party tools that your sales and marketing teams use, or perhaps disparate data sources that you need to integrate for analysis. Rather, this just means that it is inevitable that some or all of the business logic required to solve your problem is an existing, well-defined computing process or behavior.

During the planning and design phase of your Python project, be mindful to differentiate the details from the objective, and identify common behaviors in your project where you could leverage existing solutions. By developing an awareness of when you can lean on existing technologies, you can significantly decrease the time it takes you to get up and running.

An added benefit to using existing solutions for common problems is that oftentimes they are more thoroughly tested and can provide a greater layer of security than an in-house solution. For instance, Flask and Django are widely adopted frameworks you can leverage to handle some of the heavy lifting required by authentication protocols like OAuth2.0.

### Throw Away Your Code (Often)
Be willing to toss out your code and try again. It doesn’t matter if it is 100 lines. It doesn’t matter if you’ve been working on it for two hours or two weeks. You will occasionally be barking up the wrong tree. When this happens you have to be willing to let it go, regroup, ask for help, and toss out your code.

In a more literal sense, if you are beginning to lean on Python or other programming languages to solve problems in your day to day workflow, you should take full advantage of learning version control systems while working with code -- [git](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git) being the standard in most workplaces.

Keeping your project in a well maintained repository will make it much easier for you to collaborate with and receive feedback from engineers at your company. When you find that you’ve steered off course, version control will allow you to safely revert some or all of your project to a point that puts you back on course.

### Stay Out of the Weeds
One of the best skills you can develop to increase your productivity is an awareness of when you have wandered into the deep end. For the ultra-curious it can be easy to get lost in the specifics, and look for a solution where there is not one. It takes much more time to force the wrong tool to behave the right way than it does to find the right tool. This is reinforced by some of the observations in [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/):

> Simple is better than complex.  
> Complex is better than complicated.

Invest in the final destination, not the road that takes you there. When you get tunnel vision on solving a problem a certain way, or with a particular method or library, you are likely to:

1. Decrease productivity
2. Increase complexity
3. Write code that is error-prone and hard to maintain

By forcing the wrong tool(s) to behave the right way for your specific problem, you will build a weak and limiting foundation to your program.
